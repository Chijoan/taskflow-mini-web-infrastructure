# TaskFlow – Mini Task Management Web Application

## Project Overview
TaskFlow is a simple task management web application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
The project demonstrates understanding of **basic web infrastructure** and **static hosting**, without using any backend technologies.

This project was developed for the **Mini Web Infrastructure Summative Assessment**.

---

##  Problem Statement
Many users need a lightweight way to manage daily tasks without installing heavy apps or creating accounts.
TaskFlow solves this by providing a browser-based task manager that runs entirely on the client side.

---

##  Project Idea
TaskFlow is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that can be deployed quickly using traditional web infrastructure.
It focuses on how a browser communicates with a web server to fetch and display static files.

---

##  Application Features
- Add new tasks
- View a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- Task counter (Total and Completed)
- Tasks stored using browser `localStorage`
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Background image + blended glass UI design

---

##  Technology Stack
- **HTML** – Structure
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic and interaction
- **GitHub Pages** – Static deployment hosting
