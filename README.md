# TaskFlow – Mini Task Management Web Application

## Project Overview
TaskFlow is a simple task management web application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
The project demonstrates a clear understanding of **basic web infrastructure concepts** and **static web hosting**, without using any backend technologies.

This project was developed for the **Mini Web Infrastructure Summative Assessment**.

## Live Demo
 **Live Application URL:** [https://chijoan.github.io/taskflow-mini-web-infrastructure/](https://chijoan.github.io/taskflow-mini-web-infrastructure/)


The application is publicly accessible and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

---

## Problem Statement
Many users need a lightweight way to manage daily tasks without installing heavy applications or creating user accounts.
Most existing solutions require authentication, databases, and backend servers.

TaskFlow solves this problem by providing a **browser-based task manager** that runs entirely on the client side and can be accessed instantly through a web browser.

---

## Project Idea
TaskFlow is designed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to demonstrate how traditional web infrastructure works using **static files**.

The focus of the project is understanding:
- How browsers request web pages
- How web servers deliver static files
- How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an interactive web application

---

## Application Features
- Add new tasks
- View a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
- Task counter (Total tasks and Completed tasks)
- Persistent task storage using browser `localStorage`
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Background image with blended glass UI design

## Technology Stack
- **HTML** – Defines the structure of the application
- **CSS** – Handles styling, layout, and visual appearance
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Manages application logic and user interaction
- **GitHub Pages** – Used for static web hosting and deployment
